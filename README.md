Post your work on Github

### Description
In this project, I created a GitHub repository and my local repository. I worked on a repository for my BikeShare project, making multiple branches, making edits to files on those branches (For example, a readme file and my Python code), and then I made commits of the changes to my remote repository.

### Files used

bikeshare.py
README.md

### Credits
